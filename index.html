            <h2>Boaty McBoatface: The Hero We Need</h2>
            <p>
                Boaty McBoatface is the British lead boat in a fleet of three robotic Autosub Long Range ALR class of lithium battery-powered autonomous underwater vehicles. She is used for scientific research, and is carried onboard the polar scientific research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough. 'Boaty', as she is affectionately known, will be the focal point of the Polar Explorer Programme of the UK Government. Boaty McBoatface, and her two fleet-mates, part of the UK National Marine Equipment Pool, are owned by the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, part of the Natural Environment Research Council; and operated by the British Antarctic Survey, who are headquartered in Cambridge, England, and are also part of NERC. Because of its complexity and its extended range, NERC classifies her as an 'autosub long range autonomous underwater vehicle'. With her onboard sensors, Boaty will be mapping the movement of deep waters which play a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate.

                The name Boaty McBoatface was originally proposed in a March 2016 #NameOurShip online poll to name the £200 million polar scientific research ship for the Natural Environment Research Council, being constructed in the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, that would eventually be named RRS Sir David Attenborough after the eminent zoologist and highly popular English broadcaster Sir David Attenborough who came fourth in the poll. Former BBC Radio Jersey presenter James Hand jokingly suggested 'Boaty McBoatface', a name the public liked, and that quickly became the most popular choice. The name has been described as a homage to Hooty McOwlface, an owl named through an 'Adopt-a-Bird' programme in 2012 that became popular on the internet.

                Although Boaty McBoatface was the most popular suggestion in the #NameOurShip poll, the suggestion to use the name for the mother ship was not followed; the Minister for Universities and Science, Jo Johnson, announced that the ship would be named Sir David Attenborough, and the name Boaty McBoatface would be used for one of the submersibles aboard instead. The Natural Environment Research Council NERC defended its decision to seek names via an online poll. Describing it as an "eloquent compromise,” Professor Duncan Wingham told the Commons Science and Technology Committee, “The controversy over the naming of a new polar research vessel was an 'astoundingly good outcome for public interest in science’ ", and "the row had 'put a smile' on people's faces" after attracting huge public interest.

                The results of the poll inspired similar results in other naming polls. Observers of contemporary culture coined the term 'McBoatfacing', as "making the critical mistake of letting the internet decide things". In one such observation, Jennifer Finney Boylan of the New York Times wrote that to be 'McBoatfaced' is to allow people to "deliberately make their choices not in order to foster the greatest societal good, but, instead, to mess with you".
